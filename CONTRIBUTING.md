# Contributing to Kuma

Thank you for considering contributing to **[Kuma]**! We welcome all types of contributionsâ€”code, documentation, bug reports, and more. This document outlines the steps for making contributions, from forking the repository to submitting a pull request.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

- Click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of this repository to create your own fork of the project.
- Clone your fork to your local machine:

  ```

### 2. Set Up the Project Locally

- Install the necessary dependencies by following the instructions in the project's README.md.
- It's recommended to create a new branch for your changes. Branches help isolate your work from the main repository:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b my-new-feature
  ```

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Implement your changes or additions to the project.
- Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards and best practices.

### 4. Test Your Changes

- Run the project's test suite to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.

### 5. Commit and Push Your Changes

- Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Added new feature"
  ```

- Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:

  ```bash
  git push origin my-new-feature
  ```

### 6. Create a Pull Request

- Go to your fork on GitHub and click the "Compare & pull request" button to create a pull request from your branch in your fork to the main repository.
- Provide a clear and descriptive title and description for your pull request.
- Wait for the pull request to be reviewed and merged by the project maintainers.

### 7. Code Review

- After your pull request is created, you can discuss and review changes with the project maintainers.
- Address any feedback or requested changes in your pull request.
- Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main repository.

## Additional Guidelines

- Please ensure your code is well-commented and follows the project's coding style.
- Keep your pull requests focused and small to make them easier to review and merge.
- If you're new to contributing to open-source projects, the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) are a great resource.

Thank you for your contributions!
